Introduction
============

Django-Material offers the alternative approach to rendering forms in
django. Strong python/HTML code separation keeps you form code DRY and
free form underline HTML/CSS rendering details. Field rendering
customization happens in a template, not in the code. Layout objects
allow setting the relative field placement and sizes.

Build-in templates implements form rendering using `MaterializeCSS
<http://materializecss.com>`_ framework
