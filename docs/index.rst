Introduction
============

Viewflow is the workflow library based on BPMN concepts. BPMN -
Business process modeling and notations - is the widely adopted industry
standard for business process modeling. BPMN provides a standard
notation readily understandable by all business stakeholders. Viewflow
bridges the gap between picture and executable, ready to use web
application.

After more than ten years history of the BPMN standard, it contains a
whole set of battle-proven primitives for all occasions and helps you
to describe all real life business process scenarios. Viewflow assists
you in building a BPMN diagram in code and keep business logic separate
from django forms and views code.

Viewflow suite contains four libraries, and each one could be used
independently from others.
