=============
Viewflow Flow
=============

`viewflow.flow` package provides a flow implementation for the standard
django views/templates application.

The package contains no templates. The only basic functionality provided
by list and action views.

Use `viewflow.flow` if you would like to write own viewflow UI, based
on django templates.

:doc:`viewflow_frontend` is the ready to use, reference UI
     implementation for the `viewflow.flow`
